<span>What is Pirex?</span> Pirex allows users to input arbitrary plain-text documents. It indexes and stores input texts permanently in the file system so they can be searched later. It allows users to enter queries to retrieve paragraphs from stored texts matching the queries, and displays retrieved paragraphs to users. This video briefly goes over the basic functionality of Pirex. It will show you how to load documents, remove documents, and perform queries.

<span>Step 1</span> <strong>Enter the terms you would like to search for. </strong></br> </br>You can use any combination of the symbols in order to refine your search and yield the specific results you are interested in finding. The purpose of this feature is so that if you were to write out a long and complicated query, you would be able to save it in a folder created by Pirex so that you could reload it later on.

<span>Step 2</span> <strong>Go to File > Save Query </strong></br> </br>Once you complete this action, Pirex will automatically create a folder on your Desktop named "pirexData" that will create another folder inside of itself called "saves" where it will save your query.
