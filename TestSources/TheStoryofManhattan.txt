PREFACE


Here the history of New York City is told as a story, in few words. The
effort has been to make it accurate and interesting. The illustrations
are largely from old prints and wood engravings. Few dates are used.
Instead, a Table of Events has been added which can readily be referred
to. The Index to Chapters also gives the years in which the story of
each chapter occurs.

CHAPTER I.

THE ADVENTURES of HENRY HUDSON


The long and narrow Island of Manhattan was a wild and beautiful spot in
the year 1609. In this year a little ship sailed up the bay below the
island, took the river to the west, and went on. In these days there
were no tall houses with white walls glistening in the sunlight, no
church-spires, no noisy hum of running trains, no smoke to blot out the
blue sky. None of these things. But in their place were beautiful trees
with spreading branches, stretches of sand-hills, and green patches of
grass. In the branches of the trees there were birds of varied colors,
and wandering through the tangled undergrowth were many wild animals.
The people of the island were men and women whose skins were quite red;
strong and healthy people who clothed themselves in the furs of animals
and made their houses of the trees and vines.

In this year of 1609, these people gathered on the shore of their island
and looked with wonder at the boat, so different from any they had ever
seen, as it was swept before the wind up the river.

The ship was called the Half Moon, and it had come all the way from
Amsterdam, in the Dutch Netherlands. The Netherlands was quite a small
country in the northern part of Europe, not nearly as large as the State
of New York, and was usually called Holland, as Holland was the most
important of its several states. But the Dutch owned other lands than
these. They had islands in the Indian Ocean that were rich in spices of
every sort, and the other European countries needed these spices. These
islands, being quite close to India, were called the East Indies, and
the company of Dutch merchants who did most of the business with them
was called the East India Company. They had many ships, and the Half
Moon was one of them.

It was a long way to the East India Islands from Holland, for in these
days there was no Suez Canal to separate Asia and Africa, and the ships
had to go around Africa by way of the Cape of Good Hope. Besides being a
long distance, it was a dangerous passage; for although from its name
one might take the Cape of Good Hope to be a very pleasant place, the
winds blew there with great force, and the waves rolled so high that
they often dashed the fragile ships to pieces.
