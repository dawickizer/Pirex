# Pirex

IMPORTANT:

To test the current version of Pirex download the .zip file to your local sytem, unzip the .zip file, and navigate to the "Runnable" directory (folder). Double click Pirex.jar and the GUI should pop up. 

NOTE: In order to have access to the help materials via the Help>Index menu item...the pirexHelp directory must be in the same directory as Pirex.jar (it is already set up this way for you in the Runnable directory).

Go to Help>Index in order to find out the basics of using Pirex
